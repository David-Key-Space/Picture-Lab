Hi!
This project is designed to help you learn how to use 2D arrays.  In addition, you will learn a lot about Color class.

The only files you need to edit are the PictureTester class and the Picture class.

The PictureTester tasks are to complete the following:

testChromakey();
Green screen technology.  This superimposes one pic onto another ignoring the pixels that are close (distance-wise) to green.

testEncodeAndDecode();
Very cool.  This takes an image that is to hold the secret message.  That image is altered slightly (all of the pixels' red components are made to be even).
Then the message is superimposed onto the image adding one to every corresponding pixels' red component.  Then the image can be sent to someone else
and they can look for all the pixels that have an odd red component.

testGetCountRedOverValue(250);
gets the number of pixels which have a red component above 250

testSetRedToHalfValueInTopHalf();
cuts all the color components red values to half of what they were, in the top half of the image


testGetAverageForColumn(pic,col);
This method calculates the average color of the specified pic and the given column

in the picture class, complete the method
edgeDetection(int edgeDist)
